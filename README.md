# ðŸ§  Applications for MenuetOS (2004â€“2005)

This repository contains a collection of desktop applications developed for **MenuetOS** (now known as **KolibriOS**) written entirely in **pure x86 assembly** using the [FASM (Flat Assembler)](https://flatassembler.net/) toolchain.

These apps showcase low-level GUI programming, custom file format parsers, and even vector font rendering â€” all in under 1 MB operating system environments.

## ðŸ’¾ What is MenuetOS?

MenuetOS is a lightweight, GUI-based operating system written entirely in assembly language, designed to run directly from a floppy disk or small USB drive. It inspired the continued development of [KolibriOS](https://kolibrios.org/en/), which remains active today.

## ðŸ§  Historical Note

These applications demonstrate what was possible in the early 2000s on constrained systems using only raw assembly. They remain useful for exploring GUI programming, graphics rendering, and data compression without operating system overhead.
